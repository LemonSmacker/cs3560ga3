the project itself is called "javafx," which is why the root folder shares that name.

The only three files that may require inspection are

Main.java (javafx > src > main > java > com > example > javafx)
Controller.java (javafx > src > main > java > com > example > javafx)
view.fxml ( javafx > src > main > resources > com > example > javafx)

As far as I'm aware, the rest of the files were unchanged during development and are only there for necessity when using JavaFX/IntelliJ
